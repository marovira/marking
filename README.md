# marking
An automated marking script for CSc 110 at UVic.

Currently, the script supports the following:

* Automatic compilation, execution, and capturing of stdout of student
  submissions.
* Easy integration with command-line based text editors.
* Custom marking rubric supplied with a very simple txt format.
* Output to csv file.
* Capturing of instructor comments per student.
* Generates a summary file.
* Can convert student names to ids given a csv table.

Coming soon:

* Ability to automatically compare student output with a pre-defined master
  output (easy).
* Ability to supply input to student submissions (partially implemented).
* Ability to take breaks and resume work (could be...).
